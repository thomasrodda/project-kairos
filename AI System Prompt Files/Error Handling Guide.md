# Error Handling & Monitoring Guide

> Implementation guide for the Assistant: How to handle errors consistently across frontend and backend. Ensures professional error handling without overwhelming users.

---

## Overview

Handle errors gracefully to maintain user trust and provide developers with debugging information. Use consistent patterns for error boundaries, API responses, logging, and user messaging.

---

## Error Boundaries

Place React error boundaries around:

- Top-level App component
- Editor component (prevent typing crashes)
- Sidebar and navigation
- Dynamic content rendering

Error boundaries should log to monitoring service and show user-friendly fallback UI with retry option.

---

## API Error Format

Use consistent error response structure across all endpoints:

- Include error code for programmatic handling
- Provide user-friendly message
- Add field name for validation errors
- Log detailed context for debugging

Standard error codes: `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `CONFLICT`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

---

## Input Validation

Validate all inputs at API level:

- Check authentication first
- Validate required fields and formats
- Sanitize user input
- Return specific error messages with field names
- Use consistent HTTP status codes

Never trust client-side validation alone.

---

## User Error Display

Show clear, actionable error messages:

- Use plain language, avoid technical jargon
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Preserve user work when possible (autosave, local backup)
- Allow dismissing non-critical errors

Never show stack traces or internal error details to users.

---

## Logging Strategy

Log structured data with consistent format:

- **Always log**: API requests, auth events, errors, performance issues
- **Never log**: Passwords, tokens, personal data
- **Levels**: ERROR (broken), WARN (concerning), INFO (important events), DEBUG (development)

Include context: userId, pageId, duration, error details.

---

## Performance Monitoring

Track key metrics:

- API response times and error rates
- Page load times and Core Web Vitals
- Database query performance
- Feature usage and adoption

Set up alerts for error rates >5%, response times >2s, and system resource issues.

---

## Implementation Requirements

**Every API endpoint must**:

- Validate authentication and inputs
- Return consistent error format
- Log requests and results
- Handle database connection errors

**Every React component must**:

- Handle loading and error states
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Log errors for debugging context
