# Production Deployment Guide

> Implementation guide for the Assistant: How to deploy safely to production with proper environment management, monitoring, and rollback procedures.

---

## Overview

Deploy features safely with proper environment separation, automated testing, and monitoring. Ensure zero-downtime deployments and quick recovery from issues.

---

## Environment Configuration

Maintain separate environments with distinct configurations:

- **Development**: Local development with test data
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final testing
- **Production**: Live user environment with real data

Use environment variables for all configuration differences. Never hard-code environment-specific values.

---

## Database Migrations

Handle schema changes safely:

- **Version all migrations** with timestamps and descriptions
- **Test migrations** on staging data before production
- **Backup database** before running production migrations
- **Rollback plan** for every migration
- **Zero-downtime migrations** for breaking changes

Never modify production database directly - always use migration scripts.

---

## Deployment Process

Follow consistent deployment steps:

- **Run full test suite** before deploying
- **Deploy to staging first** and verify functionality
- **Database migrations** run automatically with deployments
- **Health checks** verify successful deployment
- **Gradual rollout** for major changes

Use automated deployment pipelines to reduce human error.

---

## Health Monitoring

Monitor application health continuously:

- **Health check endpoints** for service status
- **Database connectivity** and performance monitoring
- **Error rate tracking** and alerting
- **Performance metrics** (response times, throughput)
- **User activity monitoring** for anomaly detection

Set up alerts for critical issues that require immediate attention.

---

## Rollback Procedures

Prepare for quick recovery from deployment issues:

- **Automated rollback** triggers for critical failures
- **Database rollback scripts** for schema changes
- **Feature flags** to disable problematic features
- **Backup restoration** procedures for data corruption

Test rollback procedures regularly to ensure they work when needed.

---

## Security in Production

Secure production environment:

- **HTTPS enforcement** for all traffic
- **Security headers** configured properly
- **Access logging** for audit trails
- **Firewall rules** restricting database access
- **Regular security updates** for dependencies

Monitor for security threats and unusual access patterns.

---

## Performance Optimization

Optimize production performance:

- **CDN configuration** for static assets
- **Database query optimization** and indexing
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
- **Bundle optimization** and compression
- **Image optimization** and lazy loading

Monitor performance metrics and optimize bottlenecks proactively.

---

## Backup & Recovery

Protect against data loss:

- **Automated daily backups** of database and user files
- **Backup verification** to ensure data integrity
- **Point-in-time recovery** capabilities
- **Disaster recovery plan** for major outages
- **Regular recovery testing** to verify procedures

Store backups in separate geographic locations from primary data.

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

Set up comprehensive monitoring:

- **Application performance** monitoring with dashboards
- **Error tracking** with automatic notification
- **Uptime monitoring** from external services
- **Business metrics** tracking (user signups, page creation)
- **Infrastructure monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk usage)

Configure alerts for issues that require immediate attention vs. those that can wait.

## Implementation Requirements

**Every deployment must**:

- Pass all automated tests
- Include database migration scripts
- Update staging environment first
- Include rollback procedures
- Verify health checks pass

**Every feature must**:

- Include monitoring and logging
- Handle failure gracefully
- Support feature flag controls
- Include performance considerations
- Document operational requirements

**Every environment must**:

- Use separate configuration
- Have proper security controls
- Include monitoring and alerting
- Support backup and recovery
- Maintain audit logs

**Every release must**:

- Include release notes
- Follow semantic versioning
- Tag repository with version
- Update documentation
- Communicate changes to stakeholders
