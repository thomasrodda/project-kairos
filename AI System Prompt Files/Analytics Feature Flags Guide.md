# User Analytics & Feature Flags Guide

> Implementation guide for the Assistant: Simple tracking and feature controls for early development. Start minimal and add complexity only when needed.

---

## Overview

Track basic usage to understand how people use the app. Use simple feature flags to test new ideas safely. Keep everything simple until the app actually has users.

---

## Simple Event Tracking

Track only essential user actions:
- **Page creation** and deletion
- **Block formatting** usage (slash commands, toolbar)
- **Linking** between pages
- **Basic errors** that prevent core functionality

Use console logging in development, simple analytics service in production.

---

## Basic Feature Flags

Simple on/off switches for new features:
- **Environment variables** to enable/disable features
- **Local storage flags** for development testing
- **Simple admin panel** to toggle features without code changes

Start with basic boolean flags - no complex percentage rollouts needed yet.

---

## Essential Metrics

Track only what helps improve the core experience:
- **User signups** and basic activity
- **Feature usage** - which tools people actually use
- **Performance issues** - slow saves, failed loads
- **Critical errors** that break the editing experience

Avoid tracking everything - focus on core user journey.

---

## Privacy by Default

Keep data collection minimal:
- **No personal data** in tracking events
- **Anonymous user IDs** instead of real identifiers
- **Local storage** for user preferences
- **Simple opt-out** mechanism

Start privacy-friendly and stay that way as you grow.

---

## Development-First Approach

Build for current needs, not future scale:
- **Console logging** for development debugging
- **Simple JSON files** for feature flag storage
- **Basic monitoring** of app health and errors
- **Manual analysis** of usage patterns initially

Avoid complex analytics infrastructure until you have enough users to justify it.

---

## Future Growth Path

Plan for eventual sophistication:
- **Structured event format** that can grow with needs
- **Feature flag architecture** that supports more complexity later
- **Privacy compliance** built in from the start
- **Simple metrics** that can inform product decisions

Build simple but extensible foundations.

## Implementation Requirements

**For MVP phase**:
- Track core feature usage with simple events
- Use environment variables for basic feature flags
- Log errors and performance issues
- Keep all tracking anonymous

**When you have users**:
- Add simple analytics service (like Plausible)
- Build basic admin panel for feature flags
- Monitor key user journey metrics
- Add user feedback collection

**Only add complexity when**:
- You have enough users to need sophisticated tracking
- You're ready to run actual A/B tests
- You need detailed analytics for business decisions
- Simple solutions become limiting factors
