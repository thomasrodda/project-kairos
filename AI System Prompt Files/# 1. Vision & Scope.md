## App Terminology

Below is a list of commonly used terminology used to describe certain app features and functionalities. These are to be used for consistency’s sake.

### **Core Concepts**

- **Block**: A discrete unit of content in the editor (e.g. paragraph, heading, bullet point). Blocks can be rearranged via drag-and-drop and transformed with commands like `/`.
- **Page**: A document composed of one or more blocks. Pages live inside a **Workspace** and can be nested within folders in a file tree.
- **Workspace**: A top-level container for a group of related pages. Each user can create multiple workspaces (like projects or campaigns).
- **File Tree**: A file tree view showing all pages and folders in a workspace. Located in the Sidebar. Supports drag-and-drop for organization. Clicking a page in the file tree opens it in the Editor.
- **Editor**: The central writing and editing area where users compose content using blocks. Supports real-time formatting, linking, and drag-and-drop block reordering. The Editor displays one page at a time.
- **Sidebar**: A collapsible panel on the left side of the interface that displays the file tree, workspace options, new page button and other options like settings and account.
- **Links Panel**: A contextual panel that shows all incoming and outgoing links for the current page open in the Editor. Useful for exploring relationships and backlinks.

### 📝 **Editor Features**

- **Formatting Toolbar**: A small floating pop-up that appears when text is selected, allowing for quick formatting actions (bold, italic, link, etc.).
- **Slash Command Menu**: A command palette triggered by typing `/` in an empty block or after a space in any block. Allows you to insert or convert blocks (e.g., to headings, bullet lists, etc.).
- **@‑Mention**: A way to link to other pages or blocks by typing `@`, useful for building a network of related content.
- **Backlink**: An automatic reference shown on a page that indicates where it has been linked from.

---

### 🔐 **Accounts & Sync**

- **OAuth Login**: Sign in with a Google account (more providers can be added later).
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic saving and syncing of your data to the cloud.
- **Local‑First Editing**: The ability to work offline, with local saves that sync when back online.

---

### 🤖 **AI Features**

- **AI Writing Assistant**: Suggests grammar and style improvements within the editor.
- **Lore Checker**: Scans your content using a vector database to flag worldbuilding inconsistencies or contradictions.

---

### 🧩 **Future Features**

- **Timeline View**: A visual layout for plotting story events over time.
- **Storyboard Canvas**: A drag-and-drop visual board for planning scenes, chapters, or episodes.
- **Metadata Tags**: (Planned) A way to assign custom attributes (e.g. genre, character arc) to blocks or pages for filtering and organization.

## 1. Refined Core MVP Features

1. **Block-Based Text Editor Architecture**
    - **Floating Formatting Toolbar**: No fixed toolbar—when users highlight text, a contextual popup appears offering formatting (bold, italics, links, etc.).
    - **Slash (`/`) Command Menu**: In an empty block, typing `/` opens a floating menu to insert or transform into different block types (H1, H2, Body, Bullets, etc.).
    - **Extensible Design**: Engineered with a modular architecture (e.g., plugin system or block-definition schema) to support future features like embedded media, tables, and custom blocks.
2. **Pages & File Tree**
    - Nested workspace structure with folders and pages.
    - Create, rename, delete, and reorder pages via drag‑and‑drop.
3. **Internal Linking & Backlinks**
    - `@`‑mention pages and blocks for quick navigation.
    - Automatic backlink generation for reverse lookup.
4. **Workspace Management & Sync**
    - Google OAuth for single sign‑on; multiple workspaces per user.
    - Real‑time cloud persistence with optional local‑first editing and conflict resolution.

---

## 2. Unique Value Propositions (UVP)

- **AI‑Driven Lore Consistency**: Leverages vector databases and AI to scan the entire workspace, detect contradictions or gaps in lore, and suggest reconciliations in real time.
- **Visual Planning Canvas**: Drag‑and‑drop boards, timelines, and mind‑map views to map out campaigns, character arcs, and plot threads visually.

---

## 3. Target User Personas & Audiences

1. **Primary: Worldbuilders & Dungeon Masters**
    - **DM Dan**: Organizes NPCs, locations, items, and questlines. Needs both a structured wiki and visual campaign planner, plus lore‑consistency checks.
2. **Secondary: Creative Writers & Novelists**
    - **Novelist Nora**: Tracks characters, settings, and story arcs for a 100k‑word epic. Requires deep reference linking, visual timeline tools, and AI to catch narrative inconsistencies.
3. **Tertiary: Film & TV Writers**
    - **TV Tim**: Plans episodes, character beats, and series arcs. Benefits from episodic storyboard views, metadata tagging, and script‑style blocks.

---

## 4. Assumptions & Constraints

- **Platform**: Web-first MVP focusing on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- **Data Privacy**: User data stored in regionally compliant cloud services (e.g., GDPR-ready).
- **Performance**: Editor load time under 2 seconds for up to 100 blocks.

---

## 5. Out of Scope

- Mobile-native apps (iOS/Android)
- Advanced collaboration (real-time multi-user cursors)
- Full-text search across workspaces (deferred to later releases)

---

## 6. Quality Goals

These are important standards our product must meet, described in plain terms:

- **Fast and Responsive**: Editor should open and react to typing and commands almost instantly.
- **Reliable**: Service stays up and saves work without unexpected downtime.
- **Secure**: User logins and data must be protected so only the right people can access their work.
- **Accessible**: The editor should work well for everyone, including people using keyboards only or screen readers.
- **Scalable**: We should be able to add more users without slowing down or breaking the app.

## 7. Success Criteria. Success Criteria

> TBD: We’ll refine these metrics when we’re closer to launch or have stakeholder input.
> 
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Gather user interviews and beta‑tester notes.
- **Beta Engagement**: Track feature usage depth (e.g., avg. number of blocks per session, menu‑command usage).
- **Technical Stability**: Zero critical bugs in core editor flows.
