# Project Plan

This document outlines the eight phases we will tackle—each in its own dedicated conversation—to build your app from concept to launch.

## 1. Vision & Scope

* Refine and finalize core features for the MVP
* Define unique value propositions and target user personas
* Establish success criteria and high-level product goals

## 2. User Stories

* Translate features into detailed user stories
* Organize user stories by feature category
* Estimate complexity and align stories with MVP scope

## 3. MVP Definition

* Finalize essential features to include in the MVP
* Define deliverables and checklist for MVP development
* Outline rough sprint structure for MVP implementation

## 4. Design (Wireframes & UI Specs)

* Create wireframes for all key screens
* Define UI component library and style guide
* Review and iterate on user flows and interactions

## 5. Architecture (Tech Stack & Folder Structure)

* Finalize frontend, backend, and infrastructure choices
* Define monorepo layout and folder conventions
* Set up linting, formatting, and TypeScript configuration

## 6. Development (Feature Implementation)

* Scaffold project with initial CI/CD and tests
* Implement MVP features incrementally with unit tests
* Conduct code reviews and maintain documentation

## 7. Testing & Deployment (QA & Hosting)

* Write end-to-end tests and integrate them into CI pipeline
* Configure staging and production deployments
* Set up monitoring, error tracking, and backups

## 8. Maintenance & Iteration (Feedback & Updates)

* Establish processes for bug triage and feature requests
* Plan recurring roadmap review cycles
* Iterate on features based on user feedback and metrics

*Each section will be discussed and fleshed out in a separate chat.*
