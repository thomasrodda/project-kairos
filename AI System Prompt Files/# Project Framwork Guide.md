## 📚 Planned Guide Documents

These guides are designed for both reference and reuse. You can include any of them in future prompts to remind the assistant of expected practices:

* **Git & GitHub Guide**: Branching, commits, pull requests
* **Testing Guide**: Unit tests (Jest), end-to-end (Cypress), CI integration
* **SCSS Structure Guide**: How to organize and write SCSS in this project
* **Component Structure Guide**: File and folder conventions
* **Prompting Guide**: How to ask for features or changes in a clear, structured way
* **CI/CD Guide**: GitHub Actions workflows, deployment flow
* **Backend API Guide**: How routes/functions are structured (serverless)
* **Data Model Guide**: Workspace/page/block structure

All guides will be written in a format that is easily uploadable and reusable during future sessions.
